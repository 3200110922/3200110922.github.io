## Welcome

I am a student at the Zhejiang university and a student at the University of Edinburgh - Zhejiang University Institute. This is my public github repository. 

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/3200110922/3200110922.github.jo/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Support or Contact

Having trouble with Pages? Check out our [documentation](https://help.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics/) or [contact support](https://github.com/contact) and weâ€™ll help you sort it out.

I believe you can be a friend of me!
